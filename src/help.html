    <div class="p5"> Opening a Wav File </div>
    <div class =p6> For your convenience, there are five ways to open a Wav File. <br> 
      <b> 1) </b> Click "File" in the top-left corner. Then, select "Open Wav File..." next to the yellow folder icon. 
      Navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it. <br>
      <b> 2) </b> Locate the yellow folder icon in the first quadrant of the primary tool bar. Click the icon, 
      then navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it. <br>
      <b> 3) </b> Use the keyboard shortcut CTRL + O. Navigate your directory and double click a Wav file to open it. <br>
      <b> 4) </b> Locate the light yellow "Open Directory" button on the right-center region of the secondary tool bar. 
      Click the button and select a folder of Wav files. All the Wav files in the folder will be listed in the "File Choice" 
      drop down bar and it will automatically open the first Wav file in the folder. Only Wav files will be included in the 
      drop down list. <br>
      <b> 5) </b> Click and Drag. Navigate your directory and select a Wav file or a folder containing Wav files. Click the folder 
      or file and drag it over any area within the application and drop it. If a single Wav file, it will be opened and ready to 
      begin rendering images. If a folder of Wav files, it will open the directory just as if you used the "open directory" button 
      such that it will list all the Wav files in the "File Choice" drop down bar and automatically open the first Wav file in the folder.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> User Customization Tools </div>
    <div class="p6"> The user customization tool bar is the secondary tool bar. This is a movable tool bar that can dock in the 
      North or South regions or outside of the application; just click and drag the top light-blue bar. There are a few tools 
      at your disposal. Before you render a file, set the algorithm and chunk size by clicking the drop down bars. The chunk size 
      refers to the number of samples grouped together in a single unit and determines how much data is used to render an image. 
      Lower chunk size values use more data per sample unit and higher values use less. The right most button labled "Background Color" 
      brings up a color picker that will change the canvas color. If you change the background color with an image on the canvas, 
      the image will not be overwritten. The left most button titled "Clear Image" wil clear the canvas but keep the background color. 
      Also available is the "Open Directory" buton to select a folder of Wav files from your device. All the Wav files in the folder 
      will be listed in the "File Choice" drop down bar and it will automatically open the first Wav file in the folder. </div>

      <div class="p3"> Frequently Asked Questions </div> 
    </center>
    <div class="p5"> What is a Wav file? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      A Wav file is retrospectively, a rather large file of uncompressed audio data. It was developed by Microsoft and IBM to 
      store an audio bitstream. Since Wav files are uncompressed, they work better for data extraction as less information is 
      lost and condensed in compression.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Can I Use MP3 files or sound files not in a Wav format? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      Unfortunately, no. The data extraction and analytics system used in the software only functions properly with a Wav formatting, 
      so the application will only open Wav files. However, you can convert any standard audio file to a Wav file. There are many free 
      online and desktop based applications to convert audio files. We recommend using Audacity or CloudConvert.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Can you render multiple files at the same time? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      You can not render multiple files at the same time but you can render images over top one another to create the 
      same product. You can also have multiple files open by selecting a directory to open, but only one file from the directory can 
      be selected and ran at a time.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Can I customize the application? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      Yes! Both the primary and secondary tool bars can be moved and docked. You can click the twelve dots on the left 
      of the primary tool bar and drag it anywhere, even outside of the application. The primary tool bar can be docked 
      in the North, South, East, or West regions of the application. You can move the secondary tool bar with the user 
      customization tools by clicking and draging anywhere on the top light-blue bar. It can be docked in the North or 
      South regions only but it can be placed anywhere in or outside the application.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Does the application tell you what file you have open and selected? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      Yes! The selected file will always be shown at the very top of the application and it will display the directory path of the 
      Wav file for your system. If you are using the open directory option, then the selected file will be highlighted in the 
      "File Choice" drop down bar. It will also update the top directory as if a single Wav file was opened. Note that if you open 
      a directory and then open a single Wav file not in the directory, the selected file will not appear in the "File Choice" 
      drop down box. Still, the path for the selected file at very top of the application will be updated and display the currently 
      selected file.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Are there other methods of viewing the images on the canvas? </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      There are no alternative methods to viewing the canvas, however, you can move the canvas and zoom to better observe the artwork. 
      You can click and drag the canvas to move and zoom with a scroll wheel on a mouse or with two fingers on a trackpad.

      <div class="p3"> Unexpected Problems </div> 
    </center>
    <div class="p5"> Overloading the Render </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      Overloading the render will cause the program to slow down and become laggy until it eventually becomes non-responsive or crashes. 
      Overloading the render is caused by quickly switching between algorithms or trying to render other algorithms or files before the 
      previous render finished.
    </div>
    <br> <div class="p5"> Overwhelming the Canvas </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      Simply having too much on the canvas can cause performance issues or crashes. The more algorithms you run without clearing the 
      canvas, the more delayed it will be if you try to move the image. We recommend limiting the amount of renders that you do without 
      clearing the canvas, especially with the algorithms utilizing triangles.
    </div>
    <div class="p5"> Prolonged Recording &amp; Large Files </div>
    <div class="p6"> 
      The longer that data is streamed in and used to construct an image on the canvas, the more strain there is on the application 
      and the device. The amount of time a recording should be limited to depends on the algorithm, but most of them can handle long 
      recordings. For the triangle algorithms, we recommend limiting the length of a recording, or choosing a higher chunk size. 
      This applies to live recordings and opening Wav files.
